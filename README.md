# Stock-Analysis via Visual Basic Application

## Overview of Project” Explain the purpose of this analysis – 


	This project is to analysis Green Stocks and their performance in 2017 & 2018 and understand their returns and the volume traded. Purpose of this project is mainly to learn VBA codes such as Loop, ForLoop, Variable, Conditions etc. During the entire learning, we need to help Steve to understand the performance of the Green Stocks during 2017 & 2018 and how was their Liquidity in terms of volume are traded. It was a very good project and the learning during this project was immense.

### Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. – 

	The analysis was firstly about DQ stock and its performance as Steve’s parents were mainly interested in investing their savings in this stock. However, when we started doing analysis of more Green Stock, we got to understand that DQ is not as good as other Green Stocks and Steve parents can look into other options as well. 

	Green stocks were doing good in 2017 with average return of more than 60%. However, in 2018 things changed and the returns of very same stock was in negative approx. -20% (in negative). Hence once can say that Steve had only 1 or 2 stocks (maybe ENPH or RUN), from this list of stock, which could be good for investment. Or-else Steve has to look for other green stocks. We have made the Macro which Steve can use to find out the outcome of other stocks just by inputting basic details of those stocks.

	After making the original code, overall time taken to run the macro was more than approx. 3.4seconds for both (2017 & 2018). However, after completing the refactoring of the code by trying to shorten some code with new codes has decreased the overall timeline of running the macro. Now the overall time for running the macro for 2017 & 2018 is less than 3seconds (refer below screenshots)
 

 







### Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
	1)	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
	
			Advantages of refactoring is that you save time for running the macro and also while doing refactoring you tend to get more experience about how to use different codes for very same thing that makes the macro more efficient. Also, you get better understanding about the VBA while doing refactoring.
			However, there are several disadvantages. It takes time to do refactoring hence if the project is in a strict deadline then refactoring is not quite possible. Also, there is possibility that you can refactor up-to an extend after which refactoring is not possible.

2)	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
		
		Mainly pros of refactoring the original code is that the macro gets more efficient and runs in less time. On top of that, you get to learn more coding for doing exact same things. Refactoring helps in developing better understanding about VBA coding. 
		Cons mainly is that it takes a lot of time. Refactoring is a time consuming process and if the project has a strict deadline then it is not possible, practically, to refactor the script
